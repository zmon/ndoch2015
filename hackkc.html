        <h2><em>What is Hack Kansas City?</em></h2>

        <p>Hack Kansas City will bring together urbanists, hackers, government staff, developers,
            designers and community organizers to collaboratively build new solutions using publicly-released data, open technology and design processes. Anyone can participate; you donâ€™t have to be an expert in technology, you just have to care about your neighborhood and community.
